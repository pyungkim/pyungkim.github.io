In January 2026, I will join the Center for Spatial Studies and Data Science at the University of California, Santa Barbara as a Postdoctoral Scholar. I am committed to translating real-world, place-based policy challenges into theoretical frameworks that can be rigorously evaluated with empirical data.\nMy research lies at the intersection of geography, public policy, and data science. My work has three primary threads:\n\nNeighborhood Effects: Investigating how neighborhood environments shape health and economic well-being.\nSpatial Causal Inference: Developing spatial analytical methods to understand why policy impacts differ across locations.\nAI for Public Policy: Applying machine learning to predict where interventions are most needed and to advance anticipatory governance.\n\nAs a PI and GIS specialist, I have contributed to numerous grant-funded projects supported by U.S. federal agencies such as the Social Security Administration (SSA) and the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research (NIDILRR).

My research focuses on spatial epidemiology and policy evaluation. Using GIS and machine learning, I identify areas requiring policy interventions, while employing statistics and econometrics to assess the causal impacts of the policies. Deep learning approaches are also a part of my toolkit, enabling me to forecast demand for public services and devise personalized policy interventions. My ultimate research goal is to reduce health disparities and advocate for inclusive institutions.\n\nBefore joining UT Dallas, I served as a research assistant at the Korea Institute of Public Administration, a national think tank operating under the Prime Minister. I earned my B.A. in Public Administration from Ajou University, graduating with summa cum laude. Subsequently, I obtained my MPA at Yonsei University in South Korea.

I reconnected with many familiar faces and also expanded my network with new colleagues. Always grateful for the conversations and community that APPAM brings together.\nI presented on two panels focused on poverty and administrative burden. Both projects were part of my dissertation, and I was grateful to receive thoughtful and constructive feedback. Thank you to everyone who engaged with my work and shared insights that helped strengthen these projects!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kim, Officially!\n\n\n\n\nOn November 11, 2025, I successfully defended my dissertation, which examines how childhood neighborhood environments shape educational attainment in adulthood and how these effects differ by disability status and type.\nI am deeply grateful to my committee—Dr. Dohyeong Kim, Dr. Richard Scotch, Dr. Eugenia Gorina, and Dr. Elías Cisneros—for their guidance, encouragement, and inspiration throughout this journey. Thank you to all my mentors, colleagues, friends, and family for their constant support and encouragement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField Study in Kilifi County, Kenya\n\n\n\n\nFrom October 12 to 20, 2025, I visited local health facilities and met with government officials in rural Kilifi County, Kenya, to provide policy recommendations on optimal locations for promoting health education and expanding healthcare facilities. The experience reminded me how meaningful research can be when it is grounded in local realities and community voices.\nWhat made this journey even more special was realizing that it all began with a simple hello during a conference session, a reminder that one brief conversation can lead to lifelong connections. Special thanks to Drs. Hyewon Lee and Dohyeong Kim for making this opportunity possible!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n120th American Sociological Association (ASA) Annual Meeting in Chicago\n\n\n\n\nAt the 120th ASA Annual Meeting in Chicago, I presented my research, “Geographies of Unequal Opportunities: Long-Term Gaps Between Children With and Without Disabilities.” It was inspiring to engage with leading scholars in medical sociology.\nI was especially honored to share this moment with my mentor and dissertation co-chair, Dr. Richard Scotch, who received the ASA Distinguished Contributions Award. I am deeply grateful to him for his invaluable guidance and steadfast support throughout my academic journey.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJunior Scholar Intensive Training (JSIT) Summer Workshop at the University of Wisconsin-Madison\n\n\n\nIn the summer of 2024, I participated in a week-long workshop at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, which provided junior scholars with training and mentorship to develop research ideas and draft an initial research proposal relevant to the Social Security Administration (SSA), its programs, policies, and beneficiaries.\nMy research proposal was selected for the JSIT Research Competition, and I was awarded a $6,000 grant. Both the workshop and the grant are funded by the SSA’s Retirement and Disability Research Consortium.\nhttps://rdrc.wisc.edu/uw-rdrc-jsit-2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKorean Association for Policy Studies (KAPS) President Travel Award\n\n\n\nI was awarded a travel grant from the President of the KAPS to attend the 2023 Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management (APPAM) Conference."
