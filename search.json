    "text": "I am a Ph.D. candidate in Public Policy and Political Economy at the University of Texas at Dallas, where I was granted admission with the highest honor. My research focuses on policy evaluation, environmental health, and epidemiology. I employ GIS and spatial statistics to investigate areas in need of policy interventions. Additionally, I am strongly interested in the intersection of econometrics and machine learning as tools for improved causal inference and targeted intervention. My overarching research objective is to reduce health inequalities, advance economic decarbonization, and advocate for inclusive institutions.\nBefore joining UT Dallas, I served as a research assistant at the Korea Institute of Public Administration, a national think tank operating under the Prime Minister. I obtained my B.A. in Public Administration from Ajou University, graduating with the highest honors. Subsequently, I pursued my MPA at Yonsei University in South Korea. Throughout my academic journey, I have been fortunate to receive several prestigious scholarships based on merit from the Korea Ministry of Education, the National Research Foundation of Korea, Ajou University, Yonsei University, and UT Dallas.\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Interests\n\nDisability and Health Policy\nClimate Policy\nCausal Inference\nGIS and Spatial Statistics\nEpidemiology and Environmental Health\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Me\npyung.kim@utdallas.edu\nGoogle Scholar\nLinkedin"
