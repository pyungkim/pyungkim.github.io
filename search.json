    "text": "I work at the intersection of public health, environmental policy, and data science. Using spatial statistics and machine learning, I research the impact of the environment on disease. I also explore the barriers and facilitators for preventing unintentional injuries and infectious diseases.\nIn addition, I seek to design policies for correcting market failure without command-and-control regulation. Specifically, I examine the effects of policies using economic incentives, information, or voluntary programs to tackle climate change. This work includes empirical papers on carbon pricing and information disclosure.\nAside from these, I research how machine learning techniques can enhance econometric methods for better causal inference. I currently study the applicability of the synthetic control method and heterogeneous treatment effect estimation in policy evaluation.\n\n\n\n\nInterests\n\nHealth Policy\nEnergy and Environmental Policy\nSpatial Data Science\nEconometrics and Machine Learning\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Me\npyung.kim@utdallas.edu\nGoogle Scholar\nLinkedin"

Write a critique on a chart in published work (book/article/news website)(Hint: Learn from Nathan’s example discussed in class)\nFigure below indicates the regional destinations of Black and White interstate migrants from non-southern regions for 6 years. In each originating region, the South is a primary destination for both groups. But in each case, Black migrants are more likely to select destinations in the South. This figure shows the trend that Black Americans who moved out of the South returned to the South at a glance. It implies that presidential and congressional election in the South will be more politically competitive.??\n\nBrookings, “A ‘New Great Migration’ is bringing Black Americans back to the South”."
