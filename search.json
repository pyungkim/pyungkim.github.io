A comparison between manufacturing and electricity generation sectors using firm-level panel data in Korea”. Energy Policy, 162, 112773. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2021.112773. (IF=9.3, 98.9% in Economics)\n\nAbstract: With firm-level panel data for seven years, this study evaluated the effect of carbon pricing policy and analyzed how firms respond to the carbon price, focusing on Korea’s Emission Trading Scheme (ETS). Under the assumption that firms’ responses to the carbon price might differ across industries, this study compared the manufacturing and electricity generation sectors. Our panel regression analyses show that the ETS has significant impacts on firms’ carbon reduction. However, the carbon reduction mechanisms of firms differ by industrial sector. Firms in the manufacturing sector reduced carbon emissions by improving the energy efficiency of their facilities. On the other hand, those in the electricity generation sector reduced emissions by phasing out the use of fossil fuels and by giving more weight to low carbon-intensive energy sources. These findings imply that carbon pricing works as designed, sending economic signals for firms to decarbonize their economic activities. Furthermore, it works differently (and so effectively) according to the industry’s characteristics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCo-author Author Publications\n\nHong, S., Jeong, D., & Kim, P. (2024).

(IF=3.3, 94.2% in Criminology & Penology)\b\n\nAbstract: This study aims to investigate how the demographic characteristics of offenders have changed after the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, our research focuses on shifts in the nationality, gender distribution, and age profiles of money mules during this period. We utilized arrest reports data provided by the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency in South Korea, including all 1407 individuals arrested for money mules in Seoul from February 1, 2018, to December 31, 2021. Our findings, derived from interrupted time series analyses, show a decrease in the percentage of non-Korean money mules, an increase in the proportion of female individuals engaged in money mule activities, and a rise in the average age of money mules after the outbreak of the pandemic. These insights hold significant implications for developing targeted policy interventions to mitigate potential threats associated with money mule activities.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaxwell, S.

Microorganisms, 11(4), 865. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37110288/. (IF=4.1, 69.9% in Microbiology)\n\nAbstract: The extent of tick-borne diseases (TBDs) in the United States is largely unknown and underreported. Equitable diagnostic and treatment options may vary by geographic location. Triangulating multi-modal data sources informed by a One Health approach provides robust proxies for human TBD risk. Using data from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources collected from hunters during the white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) hunting season and other sources, we employ a mixed-methods approach based on thematic mapping and mixed effects modelling to determine if deer population density aligns with official disease data at the county level from (1) positive canine serological reports for, anaplasmosis, and Lyme Disease (LD); (2) positive human cases of ehrlichiosis, anaplasmosis, LD, and Spotted Fever rickettsioses; and (3) tick infectivity. We propose the need for multimodal data analysis using a variety of potential proxies to better estimate disease risk and inform public health policy and practice. We find similar spatial distributions between deer population density and human and canine TBDs in northeastern and southern Indiana, which are rural and mixed geographic areas. Overall, LD is more prevalent in the northwest, central-western, and southeastern counties, while ehrlichiosis is more common in the southern counties. These findings hold true across humans, canines, and deer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder Review\n\nKim, P., D. Kim, R. Scotch, D. Jeong, & K.
