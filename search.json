Children whose families moved to higher-opportunity districts – as measured by the average outcomes of non-mover children across these cohorts – experienced higher probabilities of high school completion, college attendance, and college completion, with effects generally stronger for children with disabilities. The magnitude of these effects also varies by the timing of the move and by disability type. The study further shows that growing up in neighborhoods with a larger share of people with disabilities improves long-term educational attainment for children with disabilities themselves. These effects are stronger when the share of people with disabilities is measured among children rather than adults, underscoring the importance of peer environments and school-age disability networks. The findings highlight that educational opportunity is a deeply localized policy issue rather than a purely national or individual one, especially for children with disabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder Review\n\nFrom Command-and-Control to Carbon Pricing: Estimating the Causal Effects on Firm Environmental Performance (Available at SSRN)\n\nSole author\nThis study evaluates the comparative effects of carbon pricing and command-and-control regulation on firm-level environmental performance. Leveraging South Korea’s unique dual-policy framework, I employ a difference-in-differences design using firm-level panel data from 2011 to 2022 to compare outcomes between firms regulated under a traditional command-and-control program (Target Management System, TMS) and those subject to a market-based carbon pricing mechanism (Emissions Trading Scheme, ETS). The results show that ETS-regulated firms reduced energy use by approximately 5.8% to 8.8% and carbon emissions by 7.3% to 8.5% across model specifications. However, the effects on carbon intensity were inconsistent and sensitive to model specifications. Event-study analyses suggest that these differing effects are driven by the heterogeneous timing of firm responses: immediate but short-lived reductions in energy use, persistent declines in carbon emissions, and gradual improvements in emissions efficiency. Phase-specific estimates further indicate that more market-oriented ETS phases were associated with stronger reductions in carbon emissions and intensity, underscoring the role of incentive-based policy design in enhancing environmental outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModeling Policy Diffusion Across Space and Time: A Bayesian Spatial-Temporal Approach\n\n\bCorresponding author (with Hanvit Kim)\nThis study applies a Bayesian spatial-temporal model to demonstrate that policy diffusion is sensitive not only to spatial and temporal dependence but also to their interaction. Conventional event-history models typically treat these dimensions separately, which can misattribute correlated space-time shocks to substantive covariates and produce biased or spurious evidence of diffusion. Using a state-year panel of policy adoptions for the United States covering the period 1960 to 2017, we compare pooled logit, fixed-effects logit, and a sequence of Bayesian models that progressively incorporate spatial, temporal, and space-time components. Model fit improves substantially as each dependence structure is added, indicating that diffusion is shaped by localized state-year deviations as well as broader spatial and temporal processes, especially their interaction. The significance of many predictors shifts across specifications, underscoring the risks of ignoring spatial-temporal dependence. In contrast, ideological distance remains consistently significant, highlighting its role as a stable structural determinant of state policy diffusion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndividual and County-Level Factors Shaping Community Reintegration Among Burn Survivors: An Exploratory Machine Learning Approach\n\n\bFirst author (with Kristine J. Hahm, Dohyeong Kim, Richard Scotch, and Karen Kowalske)\nThis study examines how individual and community factors shape community reintegration among adult burn survivors using a machine learning approach. Using Burn Model System data linked with county-level indicators from three major U.S. burn centers, we define reintegration as improvement in Community Integration Questionnaire (CIQ) scores and apply Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to identify key predictors. The model highlights both clinical and contextual influences: age, burn severity, head burn involvement, and rehabilitation duration at the individual level, and high school graduation rates, juvenile arrest rates, civic association density, transportation cost burden, and poverty depth at the community level. Patients treated in Dallas show greater declines in CIQ scores than those in Seattle, partly reflecting less supportive community environments. Overall, the findings indicate that successful reintegration depends on both patient characteristics and structural conditions, underscoring the importance of incorporating place-based supports into post-acute care.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmHealth Intervention Integrating Personal PM2.5 Monitoring and Deep Learning to Reduce Pediatric Asthma Exacerbations: A Pilot Study\n\n\bFirst author (with Juyee Jung, Dohyeong Kim, Pranav Kumar, and Daejin Song)\nFine particulate matter (PM2.5) is a major trigger of pediatric asthma exacerbations, but children vary widely in their sensitivity. This pilot study tested an mHealth intervention that combined personal PM monitoring, deep learning-based prediction, and tailored behavioral recommendations. A total of 272 pediatric asthma patients were enrolled across nine hospitals in Korea, and a 1D CNN-LSTM model was developed using symptom reports and personal PM data. Of these, 109 children entered an intervention phase and were assigned to model-based, forecast-based, or no-intervention groups. The model-based group received individualized alerts generated from deep learning predictions, while the forecast-based group received alerts based on regional air quality forecasts. The model-based intervention significantly reduced exacerbation rates, showing a 6.6% median and 11.5% mean decrease, whereas the other groups showed no meaningful changes. Odds ratios indicated that the model-based group had substantially lower PM-related exacerbation risk than both comparison groups. These findings suggest that personalized, prediction-based mHealth support may help reduce PM-related asthma exacerbations in children and merits evaluation in larger studies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublications\n\nBayesian Spatio-Temporal Modeling for Policy Evaluation: Sensitivity of Policy Effect Estimates in the Context of COVID-19 Stay-at-Home Orders (PLOS One, Forthcoming. Available at SSRN)\n\nFirst author (with Sunghye Choi, Dohyeong Kim, and Chang-Kil Lee)\nThis study applies a Bayesian spatio-temporal model to demonstrate the sensitivity of policy effect estimates to spatial and temporal structure, using COVID-19 stay-at-home orders as a case study. Unlike conventional approaches, this framework accounts for geographic spillovers, temporal dependence, and space-time interaction, all of which are central to policy effect evaluation in heterogeneous settings. Implemented via Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA), the model also accommodates missing data and supports inference in high-dimensional contexts. Using Google mobility data and policy information from the Oxford COVID-19 Tracker, we estimate four models of increasing complexity: OLS, spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal. While simpler models suggest substantial reductions in workplace and residential mobility, these effects become statistically insignificant once spatio-temporal interactions are incorporated. This pattern indicates that earlier studies may have overstated policy effects by overlooking spatio-temporal heterogeneity. Our findings demonstrate the importance of spatio-temporal modeling for policy evaluation, particularly when working with large-scale, incomplete, and unevenly distributed data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeospatial Analysis of Community-Level Social and Environmental Barriers for Adult Burn Injury Survivors in North Texas (2025, Burns, 51(5), 107512)\n\nFirst author (with Dohyeong Kim, Richard Scotch, Dohyo Jeong, and Karen Kowalske)\nThis preliminary study examines geographic differences in community integration among burn injury survivors in North Texas and identifies community factors that may shape their post-injury reintegration. Drawing on data from 153 adults in the Burn Model System between 2015 and 2022, we mapped county-level changes in Community Integration Questionnaire (CIQ) scores by comparing pre-injury levels with scores at six and twelve months. We then grouped counties based on whether survivors experienced consistent declines over the 12-month period and compared these counties to all others. Preliminary results reveal clear spatial disparities: counties with persistent decreases in CIQ scores tended to have higher poverty and unemployment, more crime, and poorer access to healthy food options. These patterns suggest that rural and disadvantaged communities may provide less supportive environments for reintegration. While exploratory, these findings indicate the importance of addressing local socioeconomic and environmental barriers to improve community integration outcomes for burn injury survivors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHave Offender Demographics Changed Since the COVID- 19 Pandemic? Evidence from Money Mules in South Korea (2024, Journal of Criminal Justice, 91, 102156)\n\nCo-author (with Sunmin Hong and Dohyo Jeong)\nThis study aims to investigate how the demographic characteristics of offenders have changed after the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, our research focuses on shifts in the nationality, gender distribution, and age profiles of money mules during this period. We utilized arrest reports data provided by the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency in South Korea, including all 1407 individuals arrested for money mules in Seoul from February 1, 2018, to December 31, 2021. Our findings, derived from interrupted time series analyses, show a decrease in the percentage of non-Korean money mules, an increase in the proportion of female individuals engaged in money mule activities, and a rise in the average age of money mules after the outbreak of the pandemic. These insights hold significant implications for developing targeted policy interventions to mitigate potential threats associated with money mule activities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo Firms Respond Differently to the Carbon Pricing by Industrial Sector? How and Why? A Comparison Between Manufacturing and Electricity Generation Sectors Using Firm-Level Panel Data in Korea (2022, Energy Policy, 162, 112773)\n\nFirst author (with Hyunhoe Bae)\nWith firm-level panel data for seven years, this study evaluates the effect of carbon pricing policy and analyzes how firms respond to the carbon price, focusing on Korea’s Emission Trading Scheme (ETS). Assuming that firms’ responses to the carbon price may differ across industries, this study compares the manufacturing and electricity generation sectors. Our panel regression analyses show that the ETS has significant impacts on firms’ carbon reduction. However, the mechanisms through which firms reduce emissions differ by industrial sector. Firms in the manufacturing sector reduce carbon emissions by improving the energy efficiency of their facilities, whereas those in the electricity generation sector reduce emissions by phasing out fossil fuels and increasing the use of low carbon-intensive energy sources. These findings imply that carbon pricing works as designed, sending economic signals for firms to decarbonize their activities, and that its effectiveness varies according to each industry’s characteristics."

    "text": "I am a Ph.D. candidate in Public Policy and Political Economy at the University of Texas at Dallas, where I was admitted with the highest honors. My research focuses on spatial epidemiology and policy evaluation. Using GIS and machine learning, I identify areas requiring policy interventions, while employing statistics and econometrics to assess the causal impacts of the policies. Deep learning approaches are also a part of my toolkit, enabling me to forecast demand for public services and devise personalized policy interventions. My ultimate research goal is to reduce health disparities and advocate for inclusive institutions.\n\nBefore joining UT Dallas, I served as a research assistant at the Korea Institute of Public Administration, a national think tank operating under the Prime Minister. I earned my B.A. in Public Administration from Ajou University, graduating with summa cum laude. Subsequently, I obtained my MPA at Yonsei University in South Korea. Throughout my academic journey, I have been fortunate to receive several prestigious scholarships based on merit from the Korea Ministry of Education, the National Research Foundation of Korea, the Korean Association for Policy Studies, Ajou University, Yonsei University, and UT Dallas.\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Interests\n\nEnvironment, Health, and Disability\nCausal Inference and Policy Evaluation\nGIS and Spatial Analysis\nApplied Machine Learning\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Me\npyung.kim@utdallas.edu\nGoogle Scholar\nLinkedin"

    "text": "2025 APPAM (Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management)\n\n\n\n\nMy third APPAM (and my final one as a student) was a truly memorable experience. I reconnected with many familiar faces and also expanded my network with new colleagues. Always grateful for the conversations and community that APPAM brings together.\nI presented on two panels focused on poverty and administrative burden. Both projects were part of my dissertation, and I was grateful to receive thoughtful and constructive feedback.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Kim, Officially!\n\n\n\n\nOn November 11, 2025, I successfully defended my dissertation, which examines how childhood neighborhood environments shape educational attainment in adulthood and how these effects differ by disability status and type.\nI am deeply grateful to my committee, Dr. Dohyeong Kim, Dr. Richard Scotch, Dr. Eugenia Gorina, and Dr. Elias Cisneros, for their guidance, encouragement, and inspiration throughout this journey. Thank you to all my mentors, colleagues, friends, and family for their constant support and encouragement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField Study in Kilifi County, Kenya\n\n\n\n\nFrom October 12 to 20, 2025, I visited local health facilities and met with government officials in rural Kilifi County, Kenya, to provide policy recommendations on optimal locations for promoting health education and expanding healthcare facilities. The experience reminded me how meaningful research can be when it is grounded in local realities and community voices.\nWhat made this journey even more special was realizing that it all began with a simple hello during a conference session, a reminder that one brief conversation can lead to lifelong connections. Special thanks to Drs. Hyewon Lee and Dohyeong Kim for making this opportunity possible!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n120th American Sociological Association (ASA) Annual Meeting in Chicago\n\n\n\n\nAt the 120th ASA Annual Meeting in Chicago, I presented my research, “Geographies of Unequal Opportunities: Long-Term Gaps Between Children With and Without Disabilities.” It was inspiring to engage with leading scholars in medical sociology.\nI was especially honored to share this moment with my mentor and dissertation co-chair, Dr. Richard Scotch, who received the ASA Distinguished Contributions Award. I am deeply grateful to him for his invaluable guidance and steadfast support throughout my academic journey.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJunior Scholar Intensive Training (JSIT) Summer Workshop at the University of Wisconsin-Madison\n\n\n\nIn the summer of 2024, I participated in a week-long workshop at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, which provided junior scholars with training and mentorship to develop research ideas and draft an initial research proposal relevant to the Social Security Administration (SSA), its programs, policies, and beneficiaries.\nMy research proposal was selected for the JSIT Research Competition, and I was awarded a $6,000 grant. Both the workshop and the grant are funded by the SSA’s Retirement and Disability Research Consortium.\nhttps://rdrc.wisc.edu/uw-rdrc-jsit-2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKorean Association for Policy Studies (KAPS) President Travel Award\n\n\n\nI was awarded a travel grant from the President of the KAPS to attend the 2023 Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management (APPAM) Conference."
