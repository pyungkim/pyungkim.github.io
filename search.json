    "text": "I work at the intersection of public health, environmental policy, and data science. Using spatial statistics and machine learning, I research the impact of the environment on disease. I also explore the barriers and facilitators for preventing unintentional injuries and infectious diseases.\nIn addition, I seek to design policies for correcting market failure without command-and-control regulation. Specifically, I examine the effects of policies using economic incentives, information, or voluntary programs to tackle climate change. This work includes empirical papers on carbon pricing and information disclosure.\nAside from these, I research how machine learning techniques can enhance econometric methods for better causal inference. I currently study the applicability of the synthetic control method and heterogeneous treatment effect estimation in policy evaluation.\n\n\n\n\nInterests\n\nEnergy and Environmental Policy\nHealth Policy\nSpatial Data Science\nEconometrics and Machine Learning\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Me\nPyung.Kim@UTDallas.edu\nGoogle Scholar\nLinkedin"
