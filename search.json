In each originating region, the South is a primary destination for both groups. But in each case, Black migrants are more likely to select destinations in the South. This figure shows the trend that Black Americans who moved out of the South returned to the South at a glance. It implies that presidential and congressional election in the South will be more politically competitive.??\n\nBrookings, “A ‘New Great Migration’ is bringing Black Americans back to the South”."
