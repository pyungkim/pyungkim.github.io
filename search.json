My research centers on the intersection of geography, public policy, and environmental health, examining the causes and consequences of geographic disparities in health and socioeconomic status. I utilize GIS and machine learning techniques to identify areas in need of targeted, localized policy interventions. I also apply design-based econometrics to evaluate the causal impacts of public policy.\n\nBefore joining UT Dallas, I served as a research assistant at the Korea Institute of Public Administration, a national think tank operating under the Prime Minister. I earned my B.A. in Public Administration from Ajou University, graduating with summa cum laude. Subsequently, I obtained my MPA at Yonsei University in South Korea.
